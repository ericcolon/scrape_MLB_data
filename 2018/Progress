----get_data.py----

In settings.py we have players_urls0 which is links to 279 players' game data for 2016.

We use this to scrape their data and calculate fantasy points with append_hitter_score_to_df.

We have a file called _ALL_SCHEDULES_2016.csv which we just downloaded.

Use this to get the opposing pitcher for players logs.

Now have hitter_data_2016_w_pitcher.csv which contains all hitter data and opposing pitcher. 


---get_schedule_results.py---
After going to https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/ARI/2017-schedule-scores.shtml for each team and downloading the schedule, 

use this script to put every schedule in one dataframe and then 

save it to schedules/_ALL_SCHEDULES_2017.csv

then we can go back to step 3 above and go from there
